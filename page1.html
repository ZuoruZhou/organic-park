<p>Data journalism is a journalism specialty reflecting the increased role that numerical data is used in the production and distribution of information in the digital era. It reflects the increased interaction between content producers (journalist) and several other fields such as design, computer science and statistics. From the point of view of journalists, it represents "an overlapping set of competencies drawn from disparate fields"<br><br>
<p>The data set I selected is dwelling structure by household composition and family composition. It mainly talks about the type of houses and people who live in these houses across Sydney in 2011 and 2016. <br><br>


<p>The government departments can use this data. For example, the Department of Energy NSW can use it in order to analyze the comparing of energy consumption between different types of building. In addition, the people who living these building will be analyzed as well because they are using energy and in direct contact with the environment. <br><br>
 
<p>Moreover, the government would use this data to renew the old city. It is necessary to change the road network after certainly period if the family composition changed in an area. For example, the area where has more younger people would need more roads or travelling mode to schools and offices. For children, they might need to have more secure playground close to their home. All these data could be used to develop the city. <br><br>
 
 <p>It is useful for real estate agencies to give professional suggestion to potential buyers about how well the property is. This will allow buyers to think whether the house is satisfied their desire or not. Besides, the data allow buyers to know what is the most family type in this area as they might want to live in a place with similar family. <br><br>

 <p>Figure – 1: Distribution of Childless Couple in Sydney <br><br> 
<p>As the figure 1 shown, the spaces close to city are gradually becoming populated. This might because majority of young couple does not have private transport tools which would conduct them live close to the public transport such as train line. On the other hand, the existing condition would affect this distribution. The conditions basically include wealth (usually the people living in city and north Sydney are wealthier than others), the family type and environmental condition.<br><br>


   
<p>Moreover, the distribution of the household and family composition have significant differences to others. The city and north Sydney area has more apartments and flats compared to other dwelling type. That because it needs to satisfy citizens’ need such as convenient transport net. The further west from city, the more houses with families with children start to appear in the map. This can prove that the property in the west region is cheaper than city and north Sydney area. <br><br> 
<p>The latte line perfectly divides North Sydney and other regions. In North Sydney, the dwellings basically are more than one storey which means the population there is wealthier than other area. In the CBD area, high rising apartments and flats are dominated which are expensive. This can mean that people living there is rich as well. For other regions, it can be considered as more standard and fit for a family living for years.  <br><br>
 
<p>In conclusion, the increase of flats and apartments is mainly due to more and more people want to live closer to the coast and city. However, the family type does not change too much through whole Sydney from 2011 and 2016. <br><br>
