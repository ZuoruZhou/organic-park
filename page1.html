<p>Childlessness is one aspect of the diversity inherent in contemporary experience of marriage and the family. With this greater diversity, once-common pressures for childbearing have given way to greater social acceptance of remaining single or married without children. Nonetheless, childlessness is a concern, partly because of its implications for the maintenance of societies and partly because of its unwanted consequences for individuals. Rising levels of childlessness are contributing to falling birth rates (as the figure 1 shown below) and strengthening prospects of prolonged population decline in many industrialized countries. For some people, conditions of employment can make it difficult to combine having children with the pursuit of an income or a vocation. A long-term consequence, in later life, is that the childless have fewer resources for family interaction and support.<br><br>

<p>In 2005, Klein claimed one of the things is governments need populations to grow because it means you have people paying taxes, people looking after the older generation, and people supporting the economy. Moreover, University of Melbourne sociologist Leah Ruppanner said while the trend of not having children varies between countries, it is already happening in Australia.<br><br>
 
<p>Thus, how to solve this problem has been hotly debated in contemporary society. In this assignment, the site is a place located in Carramar where is situated at 30 km west of the Sydney CBD.  <br><br>

 <p>As Figure 2 shown above, the site is between roughly two childless family area and it is close to the Sydney CBD which has high rate of childless family. Thus the design can be  considered as a liking point that link all these area together to promote more activities happening (Shown Figure 3 below). <br><br>

<p>There are a lot of traveling modes existed around site shown as figure 4 below. So, keeping people stay here is quite important in this case.  <br><br>

<p>Figure 4 - Circulation Analysis<br><br>
 
<p>Design Stratagies:<br><br>
<p>Firstly, The design would connect childless family area to create a new urban space which can increase more activities between those areas.<br><br>
<p>Secondly, the site environment will be an element involved in the design. <br><br>
<p>Thirdly, create a series of architecture to attract people stay and make the site more accessible.<br><br>

<p>Figure 5-6 - Concept of the Design Solution: Figure 5 shown above illustrates the case that water interact with architecture and Figure 6 shown shows the roof shape which will become a scenery with water.  <br><br>
<p>Design Proposals:<br><br>
<p>1. Using water to enrich the space<br><br>
<p>2. Mountain-look roof top will react with water to create a new viewing point in the site. <br><br>
<p>3. Creating a large park acts as bridge to connect childless family regions.<br><br>
